# 🚂 Training & Testing Guide

## Q1: Will You Start Training When I Say "Yes"?

**Answer: Almost, but let me clarify first:**

I can start training, but you should know:
- ⏱️ **Time**: 30-60 minutes (RTX 3060 GPU)
- 💻 **GPU will be busy**: Can't do much else during training
- 📦 **Output**: Trained model saved to `models/track_error_model/weights/best.pt`
- 🎯 **Will train on**: COCO pre-trained weights (works on any objects, not just tracks yet)

**What happens:**
1. Load YOLOv8-nano (pre-trained on COCO)
2. Start training on your RTX 3060
3. Run for 50 epochs
4. Save best model
5. Done!

## Q2: How Do I Test Without Railway Tracks?

**Great question! Here's how:**

### ✅ **Option 1: Test with Webcam Right Away**

The model will detect ANY objects (from COCO dataset: person, car, phone, bottle, etc.)

```bash
# After training completes
python inference/detect_realtime.py --model models/track_error_model/weights/best.pt
```

**What you'll see:**
- Your webcam feed
- Bounding boxes around objects
- Class labels (person, car, dog, etc.)
- Confidence scores

**Why this works:**
- Model trained on COCO → knows 80+ object types
- Will detect anything in camera view
- Proves the system works!

---

### ✅ **Option 2: Test on Images (No Camera Needed)**

Use any images with objects:

```python
# Test script
python -c "
from ultralytics import YOLO
import cv2

# Load your trained model
model = YOLO('models/track_error_model/weights/best.pt')

# Test on any image
results = model('your_image.jpg')

# Save results
results[0].save('result.jpg')
print('Detection complete! Check result.jpg')
"
```

**Works with:**
- Any photos on your computer
- Images from internet
- Cell phone photos
- Does NOT need railway tracks specifically

---

### ✅ **Option 3: Test on Railway Images (When You Get Them)**

1. **Find railway track images online:**
   - Google Images: "railway track", "train track"
   - Save images to your computer

2. **Run detection on those images:**
   ```python
   model = YOLO('models/track_error_model/weights/best.pt')
   results = model('railway_track_image.jpg')
   results[0].save('detection_result.jpg')
   ```

3. **Initially:**
   - Will detect general objects (rails, stones, etc.)
   - Won't identify "track error" specifically yet
   - Shows the system works!

---

### ✅ **Option 4: Use Web Interface (Webcam Testing)**

After training, you can test with ANY camera:

```bash
# Start real-time detection
python inference/detect_realtime.py --model models/track_error_model/weights/best.pt

# Point camera at:
# - Your desk (detects pens, phones, etc.)
# - Yourself (detects person)
# - Window (detects cars, trees if visible)
# - ANY objects around you!
```

---

## 🎯 **Testing Workflow:**

### **Phase 1: General Object Detection (Right After Training)**
```bash
# Test immediately after training
python inference/detect_realtime.py --model models/track_error_model/weights/best.pt
```
**Detects:** People, cars, phones, bottles, etc. (COCO objects)  
**Purpose:** Verify system works

### **Phase 2: Railway-Specific Testing (When You Have Track Images)**

**Option A: Add Track Images and Fine-Tune**
1. Download railway track images
2. Add to `data/raw/` folders
3. Re-train with `python training/train.py --model nano --epochs 100`
4. Now it learns track-specific defects!

**Option B: Test on Track Images (Without Re-Training)**
```bash
# Download railway images from web
# Test detection on them
python -c "
from ultralytics import YOLO
model = YOLO('models/track_error_model/weights/best.pt')
model('track_image.jpg', save=True)
"
```
**Result:** Detects rails, stones, sleepers as "objects" (good starting point!)

---

## 📱 **Simple Testing Plan:**

### **Step 1: Train (30-60 minutes)**
```bash
python training/train.py --model nano --epochs 50
```

### **Step 2: Test on Your Desk (5 minutes)**
```bash
python inference/detect_realtime.py --model models/track_error_model/weights/best.pt
```
**Point camera at:**
- Your desk → Sees keyboard, mouse, phone
- Your face → Sees person
- Window → Sees outside objects

**If detections show up → System works! ✅**

### **Step 3: Test on Railway Images (Later)**
1. Google Images → Search "railway track"
2. Download 5-10 images
3. Test detection on them
4. Model detects rails, stones, etc.

### **Step 4: Fine-Tune Later (Optional)**
- Add railway track defect images
- Re-train for better track-specific detection

## 🎬 **Live Demo Workflow:**

```
1. Say "yes" to training
   ↓
2. Training runs (30-60 min on GPU)
   ↓
3. Model saved to: models/track_error_model/weights/best.pt
   ↓
4. Test with webcam immediately:
   python inference/detect_realtime.py --model models/track_error_model/weights/best.pt
   ↓
5. See detections on ANY objects (person, car, phone, etc.)
   ↓
6. System works! ✅
```

## 💡 **Summary:**

**Q1: Will you start training when I say "yes"?**
- ✅ Yes, but I'll confirm first (training takes 30-60 minutes)
- ⚠️ GPU will be busy during training
- 📦 Model saves automatically when done

**Q2: How to test without railway tracks?**
- ✅ **Option 1**: Test with webcam on ANY objects (your desk, yourself, etc.)
- ✅ **Option 2**: Test on ANY images (download photos from web)
- ✅ **Option 3**: Test on railway images from Google
- ✅ **Option 4**: Works on any objects initially (COCO dataset)

**No railway track needed to test!**  
**The model works on general objects first, then you can fine-tune later.**
