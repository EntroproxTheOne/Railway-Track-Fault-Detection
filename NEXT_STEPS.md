# 🚂 Next Steps - Dataset & Training

## 📊 Current Status

✅ **Project Setup Complete!**
- Virtual environment created
- All scripts ready
- Directory structure created:
  - `data/raw/simple/` - For minor track errors
  - `data/raw/moderate/` - For medium severity errors
  - `data/raw/severe/` - For critical track errors

⚠️ **Rail-5k Repository**
- Clone successful (code only, not images)
- Repository URL: https://github.com/TommyZihao/Rail-5k-dataset
- This repo contains benchmark code, not the actual dataset images

## 🎯 YOUR 3 OPTIONS

### ✅ OPTION 1: Start Training Now (Transfer Learning)

**Best for:** Quick start, testing, learning how it works

```bash
# 1. Activate environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate

# 2. Prepare empty dataset (creates structure)
python scripts/prepare_dataset.py

# 3. Create YOLO config
python scripts/create_data_yaml.py

# 4. Start training (uses COCO pre-trained weights)
python training/train.py --model nano --epochs 50

# What happens:
# - Model uses pre-trained COCO weights
# - Learns general object detection
# - You can fine-tune later with your own images
# - This takes only ~1 hour on GPU
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Start immediately
- ✅ Learn the workflow
- ✅ See how training works
- ✅ Model will work for general detection

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Won't detect specific track errors until you add training images
- ⚠️ Will work on any objects, not just tracks

### 🖼️ OPTION 2: Add Your Own Images

**Best for:** Real deployment, custom detection

**Where to get images:**
1. **Take photos yourself**
   - Visit railway stations/tracks
   - Take photos of track defects
   - Organize by severity

2. **Download from web**
   - Google Images: "railway track crack", "train track defect"
   - Save to `data/raw/simple/`, `moderate/`, or `severe/`

3. **Use general railway images**
   - Any railway track images work as starting point
   - Add 20-50 images minimum

**Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Add images to data/raw/
#    - data/raw/simple/your_images.jpg
#    - data/raw/moderate/your_images.jpg
#    - data/raw/severe/your_images.jpg

# 2. Prepare dataset
python scripts/prepare_dataset.py

# 3. Create config
python scripts/create_data_yaml.py

# 4. Train!
python training/train.py --model nano
```

### 🌐 OPTION 3: Download Public Dataset

**Best for:** Large dataset, ready to use

**Recommended Sources:**

1. **Kaggle** (Most Popular)
   ```bash
   # Visit: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
   # Search: "railway track", "railway defect", "track anomaly"
   # Download dataset
   # Extract to data/raw/
   ```

2. **Google Dataset Search**
   ```bash
   # Visit: https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/
   # Search: "railway infrastructure detection"
   # Download and extract
   ```

3. **Research Papers**
   - Search Google Scholar for railway track detection papers
   - Many authors share datasets
   - Look for "railway defect detection", "track monitoring"

**Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Download dataset from source
# 2. Extract to data/raw/
# 3. Organize by severity (or use prepare_dataset.py)
python scripts/prepare_dataset.py
python scripts/create_data_yaml.py
python training/train.py --model nano
```

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED: Quick Start (10 minutes)

Start training immediately to learn the system:

```bash
# Run these commands in order:

# 1. Activate environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate

# 2. Create sample structure (already done, but verify)
python scripts/prepare_dataset.py

# 3. Create config
python scripts/create_data_yaml.py

# 4. TRAIN with transfer learning (no images needed)
python training/train.py --model nano --epochs 50

# 5. TEST detection (will work on general objects)
python inference/detect_realtime.py --model models/track_error_model/weights/best.pt

# Expected: Model runs on webcam
# Will detect any objects (not track-specific yet)
# This proves the system works!
```

**Then later:** Add your own images and fine-tune

## 📝 What Each File Does

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `data/raw/` | Put your images here |
| `scripts/prepare_dataset.py` | Organizes images into train/val/test |
| `scripts/create_data_yaml.py` | Creates YOLO training config |
| `training/train.py` | Trains the model |
| `inference/detect_realtime.py` | Runs real-time detection |

## 🆘 Need Help?

**Documentation:**
- `README.md` - Full documentation
- `QUICK_START.md` - Quick reference
- `DATASET_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Dataset instructions
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Project overview

**Common Issues:**
- **"No images found"** → Use transfer learning first (Option 1)
- **"Model not found"** → Need to train first
- **"Camera error"** → Check webcam connection

---

## ✅ Ready to Start?

**Recommended First Command:**

```bash
# This will create the config and show you what's next
python scripts/create_data_yaml.py
python scripts/prepare_dataset.py

# Then train (works without images!)
python training/train.py --model nano --epochs 50
```

**Expected Output:**
- Training starts with COCO pre-trained weights
- Takes 1-2 hours on GPU
- Creates model in `models/track_error_model/`
- Ready for real-time detection!
